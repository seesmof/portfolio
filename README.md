## About

This repository serves as my personal portfolio website, providing a platform to showcase my extensive experience as a frontend developer. The website boasts a clean and visually appealing design that elegantly displays all of my completed projects to date. Built using React, Tailwind CSS, and Next.js, it is both fully functional and fully responsive across various devices.
